# oci-delta

oci-delta is a tool to take two oci archive files, called the "old and "new" image below)
containing bootc images and producing a resulting file, called a "delta" that can be used to update
a bootc host with the old image installed to the new image, without having the new oci archive
available.  The advantage of using the delta is that it is significantly smaller, as it avoids
shipping data that is already locally available from the installed old image.

## Mode of operation

An OCI image (and thus OCI archive) consists of some json metadata, and a list of compressed tar
files, one for each image layer. Each layer is references from the metadata twice, once (the digest
id) by sha256 digest of the compressed tar file, and once (the diff id) by the sha256 digest of the
uncompressed file. The later is important because various operations can cause layers to be
recompressed, but using the diff_id we can ensure we're referencing the same data.

When bootc installs a new image (both when pulling from a registry or from an OCI archive), it will
look at each layers digest id and diff_id comparing it to the set of already installed layers. If
there is a match, the layer in the image isn't even looked at.

This allows the first level of deltas in oci-delta, we just generate a normal OCI image that
leaves out the tar files for the layers that will already be installed. Such an oci archive can be
installed with a command like `bootc switch --transport oci-archive $FILE`.

The above is helped by the layer chunking that is typically done for bootc images. At the build time
bootc tries to find related files (typically those installed from the same package), and puts them
in separate layers. If two different images install the same package version they are likely to end
up with an identical layer, even if the images are not directly related. This allows the first level
of delta support to be more efficient than you would otherwise thing.

The second level of delta is at the file level inside each layer. Even if a layer has changed, often
many files are identical, and others are similar to the previous version of the same file. On a
bootc system the layer files for an installed image are available in the ostree repository under
`/ostree/repo/objects`, even for images that are not the currently booted system. So, the idea is to
create a delta format that allows reconstructing the "delta level 1" oci archive file given the
information in the delta and the existing repo object files. Then the reconstructed oci archived
can be used with `bootc switch` to install the image.

To create these layer deltas, we use the [tar-diff](https://github.com/containers/tar-diff) tool
that creates binary deltas between tar files.

A typical bootc layer has content that looks something like this:
```
-rwxr-xr-x 0/0         1410656 1970-01-01 01:00 sysroot/ostree/repo/objects/8a/5d...d.file
hrwxr-xr-x 0/0               0 1970-01-01 01:00 usr/bin/bash link to sysroot/ostree/repo/objects/8a/5d...d.file
```

In other words, it has the ostree object file, as well as a hardlink to it with the deployed
path. This makes it easy to know which files can be used as sources for the deltas. We can just look
for a file prefix of `sysroot/ostree/repo/objects`.

To completely support what is required, tar-diff was [extended](https://github.com/containers/tar-diff/pull/66) to:
 * support the hardlinked structure of bootc images
 * support multiple "old" images (we can use all old layers as delta source material)
 * filtering the delta source files by prefix

Of course, some layers are bound to be completely new, so we only store the tar-diff for layers
where the diff is smaller than the original layer file.

There is one problem with this approach. The deltas (by their nature) work on the uncompressed layer
tar files, so we have to recompress after reconstruction. This means the reconstructed image will
have a manifest with different digest ids for the delta layers. The diff_id of the layers will be the
same though, so bootc (at least a recent enought version) will be able to know that these layers
are the same.

## Example usage

Create a bootc delta from two oci archive.
```
$ oci-delta create old.oci-archive new.oci-archive update.oci-delta
```

Apply a delta on a bootc system.
```
$ oci-delta create update.oci-delta new.oci-archive
$ bootc switch --transport=oci-archive new.oci-archive
$ rm new.oci-archive
```

## Delta sizes

Here are some example images and deltas between them. image is an automotive image, and image2 is a
similar build that adds a file and an extra package. oldimage is similar to base, but its older so
it will have older versions of some packages.

```
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex 318M 27 mar 11.30 oldimage.oci-archive
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex 306M 27 mar 14.25 image.oci-archive
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex 309M 27 mar 14.25 image2.oci-archive
```

Here are the delta sizes going between these.

```
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex  21M 27 mar 14.28 oldimage-to-image.delta
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex  16M 27 mar 14.30 image-to-image2.delta
```

I also computed a full delta between quay.io/fedora/fedora-bootc:41-x86_64 and quay.io/fedora/fedora-bootc:42-x86_64:

```
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex 972M 30 mar 11.37 fedora-bootc-41-x86_64.oci-archive
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex 999M 30 mar 11.37 fedora-bootc-42-x86_64.oci-archive
-rw-r--r--. 1 alex alex 555M 30 mar 11.56 fedora-41-to-42.delta
```

There is a script `tools/analyze-delta.py` in the repo that analyzes the produced deltas (with more
detail if you pass `--verbose`). This allows you to see in more detail what is being reused.


## Requirements

The target system has to run a bootc version 1.15.0 or later, that contains [the fix to use layer
diff_ids](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/pull/2081).

The required support in tar-diff has been merged in [PR #66](https://github.com/containers/tar-diff/pull/66) and is
available in the current main branch. This is not yet in a release, but will be in the release after 0.3.1.

## Delta file format

A delta file is an uncompressed tar archive containing an [OCI image
layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md), where the single manifest describes a
delta artifact rather than a runnable image. This is an oci-archive form that matches what would normally be used
for OCI artifacts, and the delta could indeed be stored in a registy as an oci artifact.

This format is very similar to the one described in https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-oci-specs, but with these
changes:

 * The delta manifest uses `artifactType` instead of a custom config mimetype.
 * We store the original manifests as layers (to make the delta applicable stand-alone).
 * Delta layer order doesn't exactly match the original "new" image, and all layers need not be available.
 * Layers that are used as-is from the original "old" image are recorded in a new `delta.reused` annotation..
 * We allow layers to be stored as the original tar.gz (if delta was not helpful for that layer).
 * The `delta.from` layer annotation is no longer used, as we diff against all layers in source image.
 * We support embedding cosign signatures

### Outer structure

```
oci-layout
index.json                          - points to the delta manifest
blobs/sha256/<delta-manifest-hash>  - the delta manifest
blobs/sha256/<delta-config-hash>    - empty config object "{}"
blobs/sha256/<image-manifest-hash>  - the target image manifest (embedded)
blobs/sha256/<image-config-hash>    - the target image config (embedded)
blobs/sha256/<layer-data-hash>      - one blob per changed layer (tar-diff or original gzip)
blobs/sha256/<sig-manifest-hash>    - (optional) cosign signature manifest
blobs/sha256/<sig-config-hash>      - (optional) cosign signature config
blobs/sha256/<sig-payload-hash>     - (optional) cosign signature payload layer(s)
```

### Delta manifest

The delta manifest is a standard OCI image manifest with `artifactType` set to
`application/vnd.io.github.containers.oci-delta.v1` and an empty config (`application/vnd.oci.empty.v1+json`).
The `subject` field references the target image manifest, enabling referrer discovery when the
delta is stored in a registry.

It has the following top-level annotations:

| Annotation | Description |
|---|---|
| `io.github.containers.delta.target` | Digest of the target image manifest |
| `io.github.containers.delta.source` | Digest of the old image manifest |
| `io.github.containers.delta.source-config` | Digest of the old image config |
| `io.github.containers.delta.reused` | JSON array of layer digests that are expected to already be present on the target system |
| `io.github.containers.delta.reused-diff-id` | JSON array of diff_ids (uncompressed sha256) for the reused layers, parallel to `delta.reused` |

### Delta manifest layers

Every layer in the delta manifest carries an `io.github.containers.delta.content` annotation that identifies its
role. Parsers should dispatch on this annotation and ignore layers with unknown content values for forward
compatibility.

| `delta.content` value | Description |
|---|---|
| `image-manifest` | The complete manifest of the target image |
| `image-config` | The complete config of the target image (contains diff_ids) |
| `image-layer` | A changed layer — either a tar-diff delta or the original gzip layer |
| `cosign-signature` | A cosign/sigstore signature manifest (optional) |
| `cosign-signature-content` | A blob referenced by a cosign signature manifest (optional) |

**Image manifest** (`image-manifest`): needed during apply to know the full layer list and reconstruct the output
OCI archive.

**Image config** (`image-config`): needed to obtain the diff_ids for validating reconstructed layers.

**Image layers** (`image-layer`): one per changed layer, with an additional `io.github.containers.delta.to`
annotation containing the digest of the target layer this blob reconstructs. Has one of two media types:

- `application/vnd.tar-diff`: a [tar-diff](https://github.com/containers/tar-diff) binary delta. Applying it against the
  source files (ostree objects on the local system) produces the uncompressed target layer tar. The result must be
  gzip-compressed and its diff_id validated before use.
- `application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip`: the original layer, stored verbatim when the tar-diff would have been
  larger.

**Signature layers** (`cosign-signature`, `cosign-signature-content`): optional. These allow signature verification
at import time without registry access. Each signature artifact adds three entries: the signature manifest
(`cosign-signature`), plus its config and payload blobs (`cosign-signature-content`). The signature manifest blob
contains the full cosign layer descriptors with their original annotations. The config and payload blobs are listed
in the delta manifest to ensure they are preserved when the delta is copied between storage backends.

Layers whose diff_id matches one already installed on the system (listed in `delta.reused-diff-id`) are absent from the
delta entirely. The apply tool omits them from the reconstructed archive and relies on bootc's diff_id-based
deduplication to find them locally.

### Applying a delta

To reconstruct a usable OCI archive from a delta:

1. Parse the delta manifest and locate the embedded image manifest and config by `io.github.containers.delta.content`
   annotations.
2. For each layer in the image manifest, find the matching delta layer by `delta.to` annotation.
   - If found as a tar-diff: apply against local ostree objects under `/sysroot/ostree/repo/objects/`, gzip-compress the
     result, and verify the diff_id matches the config.
   - If found as original gzip: copy the blob directly.
   - If not found: the layer is reused - omit the blob from the output (bootc will locate it by diff_id).
3. Write a new OCI archive with the image config, the reconstructed layer blobs, and a rewritten image manifest
   reflecting the new digests of any recompressed layers.

### Embedded signatures

Deltas can optionally carry cosign/sigstore signatures. This enables signature verification during import
without requiring registry access (important for offline update scenarios).

The signature artifact is stored as-is in the delta's blob directory, with its manifest, config, and
payload layers all listed in the delta manifest. The signature manifest blob contains the full cosign
layer descriptors with their original annotations (the actual cryptographic signature, Fulcio certificate,
certificate chain, and Rekor transparency log bundle).

At import time, the consumer can extract the signature manifest from layers annotated with
`io.github.containers.delta.content' of `cosign-signature` and `cosign-signature-content`, then verify the
signature against the embedded image manifest digest using the appropriate policy and keys.
